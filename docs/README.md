# JS Project

Maze Generation with cities (such as NYC)

## MVP

Have maze generator that uses several different algorithms to create mazes out of a city's streets.

## Technologies, Libraries, APIs

Right now, i believe I will use the D3 JS library, in addition to HTML/CSS in order to create color visuals.

## Wireframes

Are contained in this repository.

## Implementation Timeline

Day 1: Research and understand how to use D3 to visualize a maze

Day 2: Make mazes based on cities

Day 3: Make visualizations combining the work from the first two days
