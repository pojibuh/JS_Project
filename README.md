mazeCraft is an application that showcases different maze algorithms in a user friendly and intuitive way.

## Features

Currently, mazeCraft has two algorithms available: Prim's Algorithm, and the Hunt-and-Kill Algorithm. Both are capable of making 'perfect' mazes, since they will always have one solution.

## Future Updates

Later additions will include more algorithms, as well as allowing for user input.
